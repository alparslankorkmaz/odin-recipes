    <h2>Descripton</h2>
    <p>I had a bunch of lingering veggies in the fridge from various things I made earlier in the week, so I decided to make my very own roasted veggies. A basic clean-out-the-fridge type meal.

    </p>

    <p>I kept it super simple using fresh garlic, dried thyme, and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar – my ultimate weakness. Best of all, I only used veggies that I like. I tend to pick out certain veggies if they are not to my liking – like brussels sprouts. Sorry, not a fan at all.

    <p>But if the vegetables listed here are not your favorites, this recipe can easily accommodate tons of other veggies. Just make sure you get that extra balsamic vinegar and garlic – you can never have too much of either!
